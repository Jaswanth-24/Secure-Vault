## ðŸš€ About Me
Hi, I'm Jaswanth, a passionate Cyber Security student with a strong grip on Java programming and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) using Java. I enjoy building secure and efficient applications, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies that enhance both performance and security. Currently, I'm focused on mastering system-level programming and building real-world Java-based projects that blend security with usability.



**#Secure Vault**

Secure Vault Manager â€“ Java Swing-based File Encryption Application
The Secure Vault Manager is a desktop application developed using Java Swing that provides a secure and user-friendly environment to store and manage sensitive files. It uses AES encryption to ensure data confidentiality and supports per-user file organization and management.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Secure login system with per-user access, allowing encrypted file tracking on a per-user basis.

AES Encryption & Decryption: Files are encrypted and decrypted using the AES algorithm, with options for password-based key generation and customizable encryption keys.

Interactive Dashboard UI: Clean and responsive user interface built with Java Swing for smooth file operations like encryption, decryption, upload, and download.

Organized File Storage: Encrypted files are stored in structured directories based on individual users.

Encryption State Validation: Prevents redundant encryption/decryption by checking current encryption status before performing actions.

Post-Decryption Save Prompt: Users can choose where to save decrypted files after decryption.

Dynamic User Management: User profiles and metadata (such as encryption keys, file paths) are managed via JSON or SQLite, allowing flexible backend storage.

Tech Stack:

Frontend/UI: Java Swing

Backend: Java

Encryption: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

Data Storage: JSON 

Use Case:

Designed for individuals or institutions that require a local, secure vault to encrypt, decrypt, and manage sensitive documents with an intuitive user interface.
